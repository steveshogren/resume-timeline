Learned to maintain and repair several legacy versioned SOAP web services that had to be carefully dealt with due to a assortment of out-of-date kiosks in the field. Setup an internal wiki and helped maintain its Linux server. Motivated the team to setup and later helped to configure the CC.NET site for our CI server. ",

Assisted with migrating kiosk code base from using Access to Mysql, and from Windows XP to Windows 7. Leveraged python to script out small maintenance tasks. ",

Paired with a junior developer, teaching him how to use automated tests to fix defects in an otherwise unmaintainable C# site for manually uploading usage statistics. Assisted another junior developer in reviving a PHP site and guided him through learning general web programming using javascript and jQuery. "],
